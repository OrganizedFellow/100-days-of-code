> The 100 Days of Code is a coding challenge created by **[Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway) to encourage people to learn new coding skills**. The challenge follows one simple rule: Code for at least an hour each day for 100 consecutive days.

## My Personal Goals:

> -   Make coding a habit every single day.
> -   Research and learn best coding practices.
> -   Apply what I learn every day and build and maintain and update my projects.
> -   Learn Vue3.

## Desired Outcome:

> -   I have been hand-coding websites in plain HTML/CSS for over 10 years, with very little undertanding of JavaScript.
> -   I will have a greater working knowledge of JavaScript and its best practices.
> -   Use what I have learned and create more stunning interactive websites and webapps for my clients.

## Current Status:

> I am currently following several online bootcamps.
>
> -   The first one is called [The Developer Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) by [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/#instructor-1). I am about 32% through the course. I expect to complete this course by the end of October. Links will provided to working examples below in the Log
>
> -   The second one is on https://netninja.dev/. As a refresher, I decided to take his course 'HTML & CSS Crash Course' and also 'Modern JavaScript - From Novice to Ninja'. I have received my Certificates of Completion. I understand these certificates are not truly applicable in the Real World, but I am delighted none the less.

### Day 1:

Saturday, September 11, 2021

**Todays Progress:**

-   Learned about TailwindCSS and got it working in my Vue3 boilerplate.
-   Started creating my own layout using TailwindCSS.
-   Created my own components.

**Link to work:**

-   [My First Tailwind + Vue3 Project](http://jamjamvue.surge.sh/), hosted on surge.sh.

**What I learned:**

-   I stumbled across [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) years ago but never had a reason to use it. Installed it and quickly & effortlessly uploaded this project. I will most likely use it in the future.
-   At first I though that the utility-based method was cumbersome and would result in bloated HTML, but I definitely see the advantages and potential of this framework.
