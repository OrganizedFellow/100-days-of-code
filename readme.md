>
> The 100 Days of Code is a coding challenge created by **[Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway) to encourage people to learn new coding skills**. The challenge follows one simple rule: Code for at least an hour each day for 100 consecutive days.

---

## My Personal Goals:

> -   Make coding a habit every single day.
> -   Research and learn best coding practices.
> -   Apply what I learn every day and build and maintain and update my projects.
> -   Learn Vue3.

## Desired Outcome:

> -   I have been hand-coding websites in plain HTML/CSS for over 10 years, with very little undertanding of JavaScript.
> -   I will have a greater working knowledge of JavaScript and its best practices.
> -   Use what I have learned and create more stunning interactive websites and webapps for my clients.

---

## Current Status:

> I am currently following several online bootcamps.
>
> -   The first one is called [The Developer Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) by [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/#instructor-1). I am about 32% through the course. I expect to complete this course by the end of October. Links will be provided to working examples below in the Log.
>
> -   The second one is on https://netninja.dev/. As a refresher, I decided to take his course 'HTML & CSS Crash Course' and also 'Modern JavaScript - From Novice to Ninja'. I have received my Certificates of Completion. I understand these certificates are not truly applicable in the Real World, but I am delighted none the less.

### Day 1:

Saturday, September 11, 2021

**Todays Progress:**

-   Learned about TailwindCSS and got it working in my Vue3 boilerplate.
-   Started creating my own layout using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
-   Created my own components.

**Link to Work:**

-   [My First Tailwind + Vue3 Project](http://jamjamvue.surge.sh/), hosted on surge.sh.

**What I Learned:**

-   I stumbled across [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) years ago but never had a reason to use it. Installed it and quickly & effortlessly uploaded this project. I will most likely use it in the future.
-   At first I though that the utility-based methods used in TailwindCSS were cumbersome and would result in bloated HTML, but I definitely see the advantages and potential of this framework. I much prefer this to the popular [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

### Day 2:

Monday, September 13, 2021 @ 10:17:59 PM

> I've been a Github user for years, but never really had any reason or desire to `push` any of my projects up. That changed today 😉

**Todays Progress:**

-   Every Linux user tinkers and customizes their desktop environment. I've been using [Pop!\_OS 21.04](https://pop.system76.com/) for several years now and decided it was about time I had a safe place for my dotfiles as well. Link below.
-   Also decided that I should back up all the settings and extensions in VS Code. So I have a repo for that also. Link below.
-   Being a Reddit user, one generally needs to share a screenshot when words can't explain well enough. I searched for the simplest way possible to take a screenshot and share in a post. I found this amazingly well written bash script that gets the job done.

**Link to Work:**

-   [My dotfiles](https://github.com/OrganizedFellow/dotfiles)
-   [My VS-Code-settings.json](https://github.com/OrganizedFellow/VS-Code-settings.json)
-   [jomo/imgur-screenshot](https://github.com/jomo/imgur-screenshot)

**What I Learned:**

-   If I should ever have to reinstall because of some fatal error, or if my laptop were stolen, or damaged beyond repair - I can rest assured that my hard work can easily be restored.
    > I have not tested the reinstallation process, and hopefully I never will. But I do plan on someday doing so for peace of mind.

### Day 3:

# Thursday, September 16, 2021 @ 11:39:59 AM

**Todays Progress:**

-   I wanted to make a simple Theme Switcher for a project. I did't really know enough JavaScript to make it happen, but I was able to successfully get it done. I even implemented `localStorage` to store the visitors choice.
-   I finally registered for an account on CodePen and JsFiddle.

**Link to Work:**

> While they are both identical, I do plan on testing other methods using `:root[theme='dark']`.

-   CodePen [My Theme Switcher](https://codepen.io/oh_jaimito/pen/oNwoRqP)
-   JsFiddle [My Theme Switcher](https://jsfiddle.net/oh_jaimito/xzamL24e/185/)

**What I Learned:**

-   This is my first time playing with CSS Variables, localStorage, and HSL for colors.
-   The [MDN: Web Storge API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API) page shows plenty of examples to get started.
-   StackOverFlow is an invaluable resource!!!

### Day 4:

Monday, September 27, 2021 @ 05:00:41 PM

**Todays Progress:**

-   I have continued to code, just failed to document my progress 😢
-   While browsing [/r/linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux) I learned of a terminal emulator called [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty). I watched some YouTube videos talking about its features and I was impressed! Previously I had been using Tilux, and before that was Terminator for years. So I installed Alacritty and have been quite happy after tinkering around with its settings.
-   While researching Alcritty, I came across the mention of tmux, which is widely used by many Linux users. So I ended up installing that. I don't know why I never used it before! It's very useful since I frequently have multiple terminal windows open. Now I can have them side by side with minimal space used.
-   And thennn, I came across [starship](https://starship.rs/), a beautiful shell prompt, and it works nicely with my already configured zsh setup.

**What I Learned:**

-   I spend probably around 80% of my time in the terminal. While I do use VS Code exclusively for my web development projects, I use the terminal for managing files and folders, I run git in every project, install/update/upgrade my system. I have been making more of an effort to use VIM for quick file edits and am really liking it so far. Although it would never replace my workflow in VS Code.

### Day 5:

Thursday, September 30, 2021 @ 07:31:22 PM

**Todays Progress:**

-   I'm always learning more about Vue and it's amazing features. Today I came across this article on LogRocket => [Gridsome vs. Nuxt.js: Comparison and tutorial with examples](https://blog.logrocket.com/gridsome-vs-nuxt-js-comparison-and-tutorial-with-examples/).

**Link to Work:**

-   NONE: everything was done on `localhost`.
-   If I should publish either Blog platform, I will update the Link to Work section.

**What I Learned:**

-   So I followed through and made two simple blogs on `localhost` and learned the differences between the two popular frameworks.
-   By the end I was/am SOLD on NuxtJS framework, as this example already includes TailwindCSS. Plus Nuxt gave me tons more options at the beginning while setting up.
-   Gridsome requires some knowledge of GraphQL, which I'm not opposed to. I will come to that later. I just really liked the out-of-the-box experience with Nuxt instead.

### Day 6:

Monday, October 4, 2021 @ 06:51:57 PM

**Todays Progress:**

-   I revisited my previous project, "My Theme Switcher" and gave it some added functionality.
-   I've never seen a theme switcher that also changed the favicon. I was able to successfully implement that today.

**Link to Work:**

-   [source code](https://github.com/OrganizedFellow/my-theme-switcher)
-   [live site](https://organizedfellow.github.io/my-theme-switcher/)
-   I also shared my code and repo on [dev.to](https://dev.to/organizedfellow/my-theme-switcher-with-live-favicon-update-2pdh), a community for developers. I'm hesitant to share it on Reddit, though.

**What I Learned:**

-   I continue to enjoy learning about `localStorage` and reading/writing values to/from it.
-   I learned how to combine two different functions in one `onClick` function.
